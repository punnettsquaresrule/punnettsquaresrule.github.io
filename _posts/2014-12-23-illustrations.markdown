    title: "For the love of drawing"
    content: "Below you'll find a selection of various illustrations I've done recently. I believe illustrations can help communicate complex ideas in a fun, approachable way. Furthermore, they give a design a relatable personality and inject a human identity into technology. Generally I start with a loose sketch on paper, then take it into computer-land via Illustrator, Sketch, or occasionally Photoshop."

### Helios Logo
For [work](http://www.team51.nl), I was asked to make a logo for a project the team was working on called Helios. Team51's style and name is based around a space/sci-fi theme, and Helios is the god of the sun in Greek mythology. Furthermore, the name Helios was inspired by the naming of space missions, so I took style inspiration from the badges astronauts wear.

###Color Chasers
At [work](http://www.aliensareamongus.com), I was responsible for creating a concept for an iPad app that would have a color matching game mechanic. My concept was an app where small children could take an iPad, see an animal on the screen where the animal was missing it's fur color, and find the missing color. If they got the color right, the animal would do something funny as a reward. The visual style was fun and playful as the app was being made for children. Below are a few drawings I made for the prototype:

### Tutorial Illustrations
At my previous job, we were tasked to make a tutorial for an iPhone app more accesible and easier to understand. I did some quick sketches to see if visuals were a possible solution.

### Podcats Identity
For the [Podcats](http://www.katiemacoy.com/podcats) tutorial, we wanted to create a friendly experience that tied into the name and identity of the app. Thus our friendly blue cat was born:

After I created the cat, I changed the illustration slightly to suit what you could do in the app: 
{% include figure.html src="/assets/images/posts/illu/box.png" caption="" retina="true" %}
{% include figure.html src="/assets/images/posts/illu/teacher.png" caption="" retina="true" %}
{% include figure.html src="/assets/images/posts/illu/vote.png" caption="" retina="true" %}
{% include figure.html src="/assets/images/posts/illu/athlete.png" caption="" retina="true" %}


###The recipe app
I created the drawings below as a sketch for a beginning of an interface of a recipe app concept I was working on with some friends. The app would be a playful version of old-school of recipe cards.

###Hanging out with a tree
During my study, I was involved in a project to make nature more prominent in the city. This illustration was used as promotional material for the project.

###Selfie 
A silly self portrait of myself after a long day of doing nothing but coding. Sometimes you need to do something creative to break out of thinking like a computer: hence the not so enthusiastic expression on my face.
