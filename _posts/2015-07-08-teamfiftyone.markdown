### Homepage
The homepage had to give a quick and clean overview of the services that Team 51 offers and let people know they could get a free demo of Team 51's product.

### All about us
The about page gives some context to the company. I tried to show the people behind the product with large banner image. This page is also useful in recruiting new people to join the expanding company.

### We pay you to make cool stuff!
Team 51 needed some new recruits. I find that often job pages only tell what the company wants from you rather than seeing a vacancy as something that needs to fit for both parties. I tried to show briefly what Team 51 could offer their potential canidates.

### All about a certain job
Detail page of a certain job. I find transparency important, so listed the salary. The symbol that represents the job repeats in the background to be a bit playful and fun.

### We make stuff
From the homepage, you can go in depth into the the three services Team 51 offers: each one has an illustration (made by me) and a long text explaining what Team51 could do for you.

### We write about stuff 
Team 51 Started a blog. Writing about tech, there aren't really beautiful images that make a blog enticing. Therefore we determined that the blog would have five category and made a playful banner for each. That way the user can know what the story is about at a glance.

### Every site I make is mobile first
I designed the Team 51 site entirely on mobile before making the desktop version. I believe that it's always best to make sure your design works in the 'worst' scenario and then it's easy to make it work in all other scenarios.
